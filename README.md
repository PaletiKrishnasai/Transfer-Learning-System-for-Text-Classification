# Transfer-Learning-System-for-Text-Classification

This repository contains the codebase for prompt-based finetuning of RoBERTa-Large on a series of tasks with multiple prompts used for each task.

- The "SRC" directory contains the required data.  The data has been prepared using the process given in [LM-BFF](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/LM-BFF#prepare-the-data) for few-shot text classification. Therefore, you can follow the same steps to prepare the data.
- Just fork the repository and run the notebook!
